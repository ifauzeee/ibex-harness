# IBEX Harness

IBEX Harness is a production-grade AI agent memory and context management platform. It provides:

- Persistent memory (write, deduplicate, retrieve, conflict-resolve)
- Intelligent context assembly (budgeting, ranking, injection)
- Behavioral fingerprinting + drift detection
- Session lifecycle management (heartbeat, checkpoint, resume)
- Directive versioning (safe prompt changes, regression checks)
- Developer tools: SDKs, CLI, dashboard, integrations

This repository is a monorepo containing all services, packages, and infrastructure needed to run IBEX Harness locally and in production.

## Quick Start (Local Development)

### Prerequisites

- Docker + Docker Compose
- Go 1.21+
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- (Optional) GNU Make

### 1) Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rick1330/ibex-harness.git
cd ibex-harness
```

### 2) Start infrastructure (databases, caches, analytics)

```bash
docker compose -f infra/compose/dev/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Expected services:

- PostgreSQL (with pgvector)
- Redis (Redis Stack recommended)
- ClickHouse
- MinIO (S3-compatible)
- Observability stack (optional in dev): Prometheus, Grafana, Loki

### 3) Run migrations + seed dev data

```bash
make db-migrate
make db-seed
```

### 4) Start core services (dev mode)

In separate terminals (or use `make dev` if provided):

```bash
make dev-api
make dev-worker
make dev-context
make dev-embedder
make dev-proxy
make dev-dashboard
```

### 5) Verify health

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/health | jq
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health | jq
```

## Core System Concepts

### LLM Proxy

The Go proxy sits between agent code and LLM providers. It:

- Validates tokens and permissions
- Enforces rate limits
- Assembles and injects context (directives + memories)
- Forwards requests to providers (supports streaming)
- Emits traces and triggers async memory extraction

Latency is the primary constraint: proxy overhead must remain extremely low.

### Memory

A memory is a structured piece of information stored for retrieval later:

- Has category, confidence, usefulness, and lifecycle status
- Has a vector embedding for semantic retrieval
- Is tenant-isolated by org_id (RLS + defense-in-depth)

### Context Assembly

The context engine selects which directive + history + memories to inject per request, under a token budget. It ranks memories using a composite scoring function and packs them into the available context space.

### Sessions

A session tracks agent execution with:

- Heartbeats for liveness detection
- Checkpoints for crash recovery
- Replay events for debugging and dashboards

### Directives

Directives are versioned instruction sets for agents (like Git commits). Promotions are gated by regression scenarios and can be rolled back/revoked safely.

## Development Workflow

### Branches

- `main`: stable, always releasable
- `feature/*`: new features
- `fix/*`: bug fixes
- `security/*`: security changes

### Pull Requests

Every PR must:

- Pass lint + typecheck + tests
- Include relevant docs updates
- Include migration steps if schema changed
- Avoid secret leakage and unsafe logging

See `docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md` for PR conventions and limits.

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Each service has its own `.env` support in dev. Use:

- `.env.example` files in each service folder (to be created)
- `infra/compose/dev/docker-compose.yml` for local defaults

At minimum you will configure:

- PostgreSQL DSN
- Redis URL
- ClickHouse URL
- MinIO credentials and endpoint
- LLM provider keys (optional in dev, can run in mock mode)

---

## Security & Multi-Tenancy

IBEX Harness enforces tenant isolation with:

- PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) for every tenant table
- org_id namespacing for Redis keys
- org_id filters enforced in ClickHouse queries
- structured audit logs for sensitive operations

See `docs/SECURITY.md` for threat model and implementation rules.

## Observability

- Metrics: Prometheus
- Logs: Loki
- Traces: OpenTelemetry (Tempo/Jaeger)
- Errors: Sentry
