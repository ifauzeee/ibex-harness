# Phase 1 — Go Test Architecture

Hand-written test layout for IBEX Harness Phase 1 (auth + proxy). Generated protobuf code is **out of scope** for the coverage gate; contract tests live beside `.proto` sources.

## Layout

```text
ibex-harness/
├── packages/*/              # Unit tests colocated (*_test.go)
├── packages/proto/          # Contract tests ONLY (auth_contract_test.go, …)
├── packages/proto/gen/go/   # Generated — no mechanical tests; excluded from gate
├── services/*/
│   ├── internal/*/          # Unit tests colocated
│   ├── *_integration_test.go  # //go:build integration
│   └── proxy_security_sec*.go # SEC matrix (integration)
└── infra/testing/testutil/  # Shared factories (SeedOrganization, SeedToken, …)
```

## Pyramid (this project)

| Layer | Share | Focus |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Unit | 60–65% | Token parse, permissions, validation, apierror, middleware with fakes |
| Integration | 30–35% | Postgres RLS, proxy→auth, Redis RPM, SEC matrix |
| E2E | ~5% | `make dev-smoke`; future k6 |

## Mock boundaries

| Mock | Real |
|------|------|
| gRPC `AuthServiceClient` at proxy boundary | Postgres for RLS |
| miniredis for unit RPM | `token.Validator` DB lookup |
| | Internal domain logic under test |

## Fixture inventory (`infra/testing/testutil`)

| Helper | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `SeedOrganization` | Org row via service account |
| `SeedUser` | User in org |
| `SeedAgent` / `SeedAgentWithStatus` | Agent lifecycle |
| `SeedToken` / `token_fixtures.go` | PAT with Argon2 hash |
| `WithServiceAccount` | RLS bypass for setup |
| `postgres.go` / `bootstrap.go` | DSN, migrate, test DB |

## Coverage gate scope

- **Included:** `packages/*` (except `packages/proto/gen/go`), `services/auth`, `services/proxy`
- **Excluded:** `packages/proto/gen/go/**` (generated stubs), `infra/**` (test fixtures, migrate CLI — covered by dedicated jobs)
- **Contract tests:** `packages/proto/*_contract_test.go` — compile-time + descriptor checks
- **Gate script:** `infra/scripts/coverage-gate.sh` filters merged profile before enforcing ≥94%

## Tier policy (Phase 0 audit)

| Tier | Action | Examples |
|------|--------|----------|
| A | KEEP | SEC suite, integration tests, contract tests, grpc unit tests |
| B | DELETE | nil-getter, accessor padding, grpc_extra iteration in gen/ |
| C | AUGMENT | cmd wiring, validation edges, healthcheck, ratelimit |
| D | REWRITE sections | `time.Sleep` in shutdown tests → sync/poll |
