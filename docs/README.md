# IBEX Harness — Documentation Index

Canonical documentation for the monorepo. Implementation has not started; these docs define the target system.

## Start here

1. [PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](PROJECT_CONTEXT.md) — vision, problem, capabilities, and phases
2. [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) — services, data flows, security, deployment topology
3. [TECH_STACK.md](TECH_STACK.md) — approved technologies and rationale
4. [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) — threat model, tenant isolation, auth, and checklists
5. [TESTING_STRATEGY.md](TESTING_STRATEGY.md) — test pyramid, CI gates, and no-mock rules

Then use [DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) for day-to-day workflow and PR expectations.

**AI-assisted work:** read [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and copy prompts from [../prompts/](../prompts/) (see [../PROMPTS.md](../PROMPTS.md)).
